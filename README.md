   ```

## Usage
1. Retrieve weather data: The program retrieves weather forecast data using the WeatherAPI. 
2. Check if it will rain: The program checks if it will rain in the next 12 hours by analyzing the weather condition codes in the weather data.
3. Send SMS message: The program sends an SMS message to the user advising them whether they should bring an umbrella or not based on the result of the previous step.

## File structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py      # Main program file
```

## Functions:
Retrieving Weather Data:
```python
from requests import *

api_key = "Enter the api_key of your own weather api account"

parameters = {
    "q": [11.601730, 79.518740],
    "key": api_key,
}
response = get(url="http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json",  params=parameters)
response.raise_for_status()
weather_data = response.json()
```
Checking if it will rain:
```python
hourly_weather_data = weather_data["forecast"]["forecastday"][0]["hour"]
twelve_hours_report = hourly_weather_data[8:20]
weather_codes = []
for i in range(len(twelve_hours_report)):
    weather_codes.append(twelve_hours_report[i]["condition"]["code"])
will_rain = False
for codes in weather_codes:
    if codes == 1063 or 1180 <= codes <= 1200:
        will_rain = True
```
Sending SMS Message:
```python
if will_rain:
    client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)
    message = client.messages \
                    .create(
                         body="Bringing an umbrella is advisory as it will rain today â˜”",
                         from_='replace with your own twilio trail phone number',
                         to='replace with the number to which you have to send your message'
                     )
else:
    client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)
    message = client.messages \
        .create(body="You just don't need an umbrella as it going to be a brighter day ðŸŒž",
                from_='replace with your own twilio trail phone number',
                to='replace with the number to which you have to send your message'
                )
```
